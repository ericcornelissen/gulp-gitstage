### Commit messages

Commits for this project follow the [Conventional Commit] format. Although
contributions not following this convention are generally still accepted, it is
encouraged to try to follow the convention to the best of your ability.

[husky] is used to enforce the format locally. If your commit does not follow
the convention you may see something like this:

```shell
$ git commit -m "this is not a valid commit message"
i   input: this is not a valid commit message
x   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
x   type may not be empty [type-empty]
x   found 2 problems, 0 warnings
```

If needed you can bypass the check by adding `--no-verify` to the command:

```shell
$ git commit -m "this is not a valid commit message" --no-verify
```
